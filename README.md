Hi, I am Tom van den Bosch. If you're on this page, you are probably either a gamer or a scientist, with the latter being much more likely.

I am currently a PhD student at the Amsterdam University Medical Center working on a multitude of projects in a group mainly focused on oncology. Some projects that I am working on:
 - Modelling of homeostasis in the acinar pancreas. Although not directly cancer-related, I believe that a better understanding of the pancreas itself will aid in better understanding pancreatic tumours. This code is freely available at @tomvdbosch/AcinarDynamics. If you are looking for the single-cell RNAseq data from this project, it can be found @vermeulenlab/pancreas
 - Using machine learning to predict risk factors for colorectal cancer. This project has been published in JAMA Network Open and can be found at doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.7737. For this project, no code has been published as it is very straightforward. Any details regarding methods, imputation, R packages etc can be found in the paper.
 - Combining Whole-Genome Sequencing, RNAseq and Immunihistochemistry from multi-region sampling in Colorectal cancer to better understand the origin of heterogeneity and the growth of tumours. (Work in progress)
 
Please do not hesitate to message me at t.vandenbosch@amsterdamumc.nl if you have a question regarding any of these projects.

If instead you are a gamer then you have probably found this page through Epicinium at @abunchofhacks/Epicinium. Epicinium is a strategy game made by two of my friends @SLiV and @Unarmedlad, and I have written an AI for their game. The developers unfortunately have to do any work on the game in their spare time, so any community aid is helpful. This game was written in C++ (which is a language that I do not know) but their code is easy enough to read that I was able to program a bot myself. I am also currently working on a custom campaign for the game when I do have some spare time. 

If you want to create an AI for Epicinium yourself and need help or if you have a fun idea and want to collaborate don't hesitate to send me a message or join the Epicinium discord, there's always people willing to help! If you have ideas to improve the AI I would also be happy to implement them, there is still a long way to go before Epicinium AI can beat the best human players.
